From the moment Weecoins is launched, it already has ready-to-use stores and customers. Additionally, it is one of the rare cryptocurrencies with its own exchange. Weecomi International's proprietary gaming application, Weemobil, with 170,000 customers, will add further value by allowing payments with Weecoins."
